    Based on the predictions, here are some recommended actions:

    **1. Burnout & Stress**
    - Introduce short-term leaves or mental health days.
    - Encourage reduction in work hours if over 55/week.
    - Offer mindfulness or resilience workshops.

    **2. Support & Well-Being**
    - Ensure the employee has access to therapy and internal support resources.
    - Encourage regular manager 1-on-1 check-ins.
    - Promote team bonding or peer-support programs.

    **3. Productivity & Engagement**
    - Reassign tasks to match employee strengths.
    - Create a career growth plan if CareerGrowthScore < 6.
    - Monitor work-life balance via engagement surveys.

    **4. Attrition Risk**
    - Have a transparent conversation about career path and satisfaction.
    - Recognize and reward positive contributions.
    - If patterns persist, consider offering internal mobility or mentoring.
